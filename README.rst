Broker
======

Function dispatch in Python based on MIME Accept-* headers.

Initialize a broker with some dispatched-to functions matched against MIME
types::

    >>> b = Broker()
    >>> html_handler = b.add("text/html", lambda x: (1, x))
    >>> xml_handler = b.add("application/xml", lambda x: (2, x))
    >>> json_handler = b.add("application/json", lambda x: (3, x))

Select a backend function based on an Accept header::

    >>> b.select("text/html") is html_handler
    True
    >>> b.select("text/html,application/json") is html_handler
    True
    >>> b.select("text/html;q=0.1,application/json") is json_handler
    True

Call the backend function directly::

    >>> b("text/html", 'hello')
    (1, 'hello')
    >>> b("text/html,application/json", 'world')
    (2, 'world')
    >>> b("text/html;q=0.1,application/json", 'json_stuff')
    (3, 'json_stuff')

Underneath the hood, Broker uses `webob.acceptparse`_ to parse Accept headers
and match against your registered functions. More docs can be found at
http://broker.readthedocs.org/.
